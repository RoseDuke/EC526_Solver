MPI:

To change the problem size, change the Lx and Ly at the very beginning of the program. Notice in our scenerio Lx must equal to Ly.

To compile the executable file, the command is

$make mpi_CG_solver

To run the executable file, the command is 

mpirun -np n mpi_CG_solver

n is the number of processors, required to be a multiple of 2. 

After the execution, there will be a text file in the working directory.
