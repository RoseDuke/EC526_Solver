1. To run Jacobi:

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_jacobi_2d
./pj_jacobi_2d
```

2. To run red-black:

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_red_black
./pj_red_black
```

3. To run red_black with simple openacc:

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_red_black_openacc
./pj_red_black_openacc
```

4. To run red_black with loop collapse

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_red_black_collapse
./pj_red_black_collapse
```

5. To run red_black with blocking

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_red_black_blocking
./pj_red_black_blocking
```

6. To run red_black with data transfer optimization

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_red_black_memory
./pj_red_black_memory
```

7. To run red_black with low_precision

```
make -k -f makeACC pj_red_black_low_precision
./pj_red_black_low_precision
```



To change N, need to manually change the N defined in the first line of main function (also need to modify the end condition).
